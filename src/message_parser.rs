/// A MessageParser allows hotwire to parse & display messages related to
/// a certain protocol, for instance HTTP. The message parser deals with
/// parsing packets as well as displaying them.
///
/// The first step is to take TSharkPackets and build a StreamData from it.
/// The StreamData contains among other things a list of messages, which
/// the parser builds from the packets. Conceptually the MessageParser
/// trait "should" have two associated types: one for a StreamGlobals type
/// specific for the parser, and one for a MessageData type specific
/// for the parser.
/// This was attempted in the 'better_types' branch, but it complicated
/// many things, because then it was not possible to iterate over parsers
/// or over messages from different parsers.
///
/// Instead we now have a "workaround" where MessageData and StreamGlobals
/// are enums and basically each parser puts and expects to find its own
/// type. Hopefully a better solution can be found in the future.
///
/// So, one TSharkPacket may cause you to create zero, one, or multiple
/// MessageData messages. You also must try to populate the
/// ClientServerInfo, letting hotwire know who is the server and who is
/// the client, based on your protocol knowledge.
/// Because we can parse realtime traffic that is being recorded live,
/// you don't get the list of packets all at once, rather you can store
/// your state in your 'globals' object, and you get fed new packets
/// through 'add_to_packet'. After the last packet, 'finish_stream' will
/// be called for you to clean up your state.
///
/// Then there are methods for populating the GUI treeview, the details
/// area, and others.
